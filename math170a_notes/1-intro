Probabilistic Model
	(Ω, F, P)
	Ω - Sample Space
		The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment.
		A single coin toss - Ω = {H, T}
		Two coin tosses - Ω = {HH, HT, TH, TT}
	F - A collection of all events
		An event is a subset of Ω.
		A single coin toss - F = {∅, {H}, {T}, {H,T}}
		A double coin tosses - more complicated
	P - Probability
		P: F-> R, assigns a real value probability to every event in F
		A single coin toss - P = {0, 0.5, 0.5, 1}

Probability Axioms
	Nonnegativity
		0 ≤ P(A) ≤ 1
		For all A ∈ F
	Normalization
		P(Ω) = 1
		P(∅) = 0
	Additivity
		Let A₁, A₂,... be a sequence of pairwise disjoint events
		P(∪ Aᵢ) = ∑ P(A₁)

Set Theory
	A set is a collection of objects.

	x ∈ S if x belongs to S
	S ⊂ T if for all x ∈ S, x ∈ T
	S = T if S ⊆ T and T ⊆ S

	S ∪ T = {x ∈ S or x ∈ T}
	S ∩ T = {x ∈ S and x ∈ T}
	Sᶜ = {x ∈ Ω | x ∉ S}

	Disjoint Sets
		Sᵢ ∩ Sⱼ = ∅ for all i,j
	Partition
		A₁,A₂,... such that A₁,A₂,... are disjoint and
		A₁∪A₂∪... = S

	DeMorgan's Laws
		(∪ Sᵢ)ᶜ = ∩ Sᵢᶜ
		(∩ Sᵢ)ᶜ = ∪ Sᵢᶜ

	Commutative, Associative, Distributive Laws
		A ∩ B = B ∩ A
		(A ∩ B) ∩ C = A ∩ (B ∩ C)
		A ∩ (B ∪ C) = (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ C)

	Absorption Laws
		A ∪ (A ∩ B) = A
		A ∩ (A ∪ B) = A

	DeMorgan's Laws
		(∪ Sᵢ)ᶜ = ∩ Sᵢᶜ
		(∩ Sᵢ)ᶜ = ∪ Sᵢᶜ
