Discrete Uniform Random Variable
	Takes values from a to b with equal probability

	pₓ(k) 	= 1/(b-a+1) for k=a,...,b
	E[X] 	= (a+b)/2
	var(X) 	= ((b-a+1)²-1)/12

	Remember that
	∑ x² 	= n(n+1)(2n+1)/6

Bernoulli Random Variable
	X ~ Ber(p)
	Takes values 1 or 0, with probability p or 1-p, respectively.

	pₓ(k)	= p 	k=1
			= 1-p	k=0
	E[X] 	= p
	var(X) 	= p(1-p)

Binomial Random Variable
	X ~ Bin(n,p)
	Takes values 0,...,n.
	Where X=k means k items succeeded, each with probability p, and there are (n k) such cases where X=k.

	pₓ(k)	= (n k)pᵏ(1-p)ⁿ⁻ᵏ
	E[X]	= np
	var(X)	= np(1-p)

	E[X] = E[X1] + ... + E[Xn] where Xi is a Bernoulli Random Variable

Geometric Random Variable
	X ~ Geom(p)
	Takes value k if we get our success, with probability p, on the kth try.

	pₓ(k)	= (1-p)ᵏ⁻¹p
	E[X]	= 1/p
	var(X)	= (1-p)/p²

Poisson Random Variable
	X ~ Poisson(λ)
	An approximation of the Binomial Random Variable when n is very large, p is very small, and
	λ = np
	Basically counts rare events that are independent of each other.

	pₓ(k)	= e^-λ λᵏ/k!

	Remember that
		∑ λᵏ/k! from k=0 to infinity
		= e^λ
		and that
		lim n->∞ (1+λ/n)ⁿ
		= e^λ
	Proof:
		(n k)pᵏ(1-p)ⁿ⁻ᵏ
		= n!/(k!(n-k)!)(λ/n)ᵏ(1-λ/n)ⁿ⁻ᵏ
		= λᵏ/k!(1-λ/n)ⁿ(1-λ/n)⁻ᵏ
			when n is very large
		= λᵏ/k!(1-λ/n)ⁿ
			when n is very large
		= e^-λ λᵏ/k!

	E[X]	= λ
	var(X)	= λ
