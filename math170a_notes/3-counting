Counting Principle
	Consider a process with k stages
	Suppose there are náµ¢ possible results the ith stage.
	Then the total # of possible results is
	n1n2...nk

Permutation
	Suppose there are n objects.
	We want to pick k objects and arrange them in a sequence.
	How many such sequences?
	There are k stages, with n results at the first, n-1 results at the second, ...

	n!/(n-k)!

Combination
	Suppose there are n objects.
	We want to pick k objects and order doesn't matter.
	How many possible choices?

	# of choices * k! = n!/(n-k)!

	n!/((n-k)!k!)

Partition
	Suppose we have an n element set.
	Suppose we have non-negative integers k1, k2, ..., kr such that
	k1+k2+...+kr = n
	Suppose we partition our set into r subsets, with the ith subset having ki elements.
	How many such partitions exist?

	First stage:	(n k1)
	Second stage:	(n-k1 k2)
	...
	rth stage:		(n-k1-...kr-1 kr) = (kr kr)

	n!/(k1!k2!...kr!)
