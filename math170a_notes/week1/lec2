Probabilistic Model
	Sample Space Ω
		The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment
		A sample point w means w ∈ Ω
	Event
		A subset of Ω
		F is the collection of all events
	Probability
		ℙ : F -> ℝ
		A function that assigns a number to each event in F

Example: Coin Toss
	Ω = {H, T}
	F = {ø, {H}, {T}, {H,T}}
	ℙ = {0, 0.5, 0.5, 0}
