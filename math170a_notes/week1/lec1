Bertrand Paradox
	Probability may not be well defined if the mechanism that produces randomness is not clearly defined.
	Ex:
		We have an equilateral triangle inside a circle.
		Suppose a chord is chosen at random.
		Probability that chord is longer than a side of the triangle?

		Method 1:
			Place one endpoint at a vertex of the triangle.
			The other endpoint can go anywhere along the circumference...
			1/3 of the circumference will produce a longer chord.

		Method 2:
			Draw diameter from one vertex of triangle, so that it is perpendicular to the base.
			Draw a chord such that is perpendicular to the diameter...
			1/2 of the diameter will produce a longer chord.

		Method 3:
			Draw an inner circle of diameter equal to the radius.
			If the midpoint of the chord is in the inner circle, it will be a longer chord...
			1/4 of the area is the inner circle.
