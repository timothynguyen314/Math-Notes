Purpose of Matrix
	If A is an m x n matrix
	A =
		a11	a12	...	a1n
		a21
		.
		.
		.
		am1 am2 ... amn

	if x ∈ ℝn, then Ax ∈ ℝm

	The main purpose of a matrix is to define a linear function that goes from ℝn -> ℝm, x -> Ax

Unit Vector
	e1 = <1, 0, 0, ...>
	e2 = <0, 1, 0, ...>
	e3 = <0, 0, 1, ...>

	Aei = ith column of A

Matrix Vector Multiplication
	Think of an m x n matrix as n adjacent m-dimensional vectors
	(v1 | v2 | v3 | ... | vn)

	The matrix vector multiplication Ax produces
	λ1v1 + λ2v2 + λ3v3 + ... + λnvn
	where λi are the constants of the vector x.
	Ax produces a linear combination of its columns.

Matrix Matrix Multiplication
	If A is m x n, and B is n x p, then AB produces an m x p matrix.

	B = (w1 | w2 | w3 | ... | wp)
	AB = (Aw1 | Aw2 | Aw3 | ... | Awp)
