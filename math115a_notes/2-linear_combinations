Linear Combination
	Definition
		v ∈ V is a linear combination IFF v1,...,v2 ∈ V and λ1,...,λn ∈ F st
		v = λ1v1 + ... + λnvn	
Span
	Definition
		span(S) := {v ∈ V : v is a linear combination of vectors in S}
		span({v1,...,vn}) := {λ1v1+...+λnvn : λ1,...,λn ∈ F}
	Theorems
		1) If S ⊆ V, span(S) is a subspace of V
		2) span(S) is the smallest subspace containing S
Linear Dependence and Linear Independence
	Definition
		{v1,...,vn} are linearly dependent IFF there exists λ1,...,λn ∈ F st
		λ1v1 + ... + λnvn = 0

		If λ1=...=λn = 0, this is the trivial dependency relation.
		{v1,...,vn} are linearly independent if the only dependency relation is the trivial one.
	Theorems
		1)
			If {v1,...,vn} is LD, then {v1,...,vm} with m>n is LD
			If {v1,...,vn} is LI, then {v1,...,vm} with m<n is LI
		2) If {v1,...,vn} is LI, then {v1,...,vn+1} is LD IFF vn+1 ∈ span({v1,...,vn})
Bases and Dimension
	Definition of Basis
		span({v1,...,vn}) = V
		{v1,...,vn} is LI
	Definition of Dimension
		Finite Dimensional if V = span(finite set)
		Infinite Dimensional otherwise

		dim(V) = # of elements in basis
	Theorems
		1) {v1,...,vn} is a basis if ∀v ∈ V, there exists λ1,...,λn ∈ F st v = λ1v1+...+λnvn
		2) If the tuple (v1,...,vn) spans V, then a subtuple is a basis
		3)
			If W is a subspace of V, dim(W) ≤ dim (V).
			If dim(W) = dim(V), W = V.
			
			Any basis for W can be extended to become a basis for V.
	Replacement Theorem
		Suppose (v1,...,vm) is LI and that (w1,...,wn) spans V
		Then m ≤ n
		And we can choose n-m vectors from (w1,...,wn) that, together with (v1,...,vm), spans V

		Thus if the tuples are both bases, m = n
	Theorem when dim(V) = n
		1) If {v1,...,vm} spans V, m ≥ n
		2) If {v1,...,vn} spans V, it is a basis
		3) If {v1,...,vm} is LI, m ≤ n and we can find m-n additional vectors to find a basis
		4) If {v1,...,vn} is LI, it is a basis
