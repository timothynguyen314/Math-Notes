Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
	Definition
		v is an eigenvector of T IFF
		v ≠ 0
		Tv = λv for some eigenvalue λ ∈ F

		ker(T - λ1v) is the eigenspace Eλ corresponding to λ

		characteristic polynomial
			cT(x) = det(T - x1v)
		algebraic multiplicity
			dim(Eλ) = null(T - λ1v)
		geometric multiplicity
			max{k ∈ N : (x-λ)ᵏ is a factor of cT(x)}
	Theorems
		1)
			v is an eigenvector IFF v ∈ ker(T - λ1v) \ {0}
			λ is an eigenvalue IFF ker(T - λ1v) ≠ {0}
		2) Eigenvectors are linearly independent.
		3) The linearly independent tuples of every eigenspace are all linearly independent.
		4) λ is an eigenvalue IFF it is a root of cT(x)
		5) cT(x) splits over F, meaning it can be written as cT(x) = c(x - σ1)(x - σ2)...(x - σn)
		6) 1 ≤ geometric multiplicity ≤ algebraic multiplicity
Diagonalizability
	Definition
		A linear transformation is diagonalizable if it has a basis made of eigenvectors.
		If B = (v1,...,vn) is a basis of eigenvectors, [T]B_B is a diagonal matrix.
	Theorems
		1) If T:V->V has dim(V) distinct eigenvalues, T is diagonalizable
		2) T is diagonalizable IFF algebraic multiplicity = geometric multiplicity
