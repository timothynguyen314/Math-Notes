Vector Spaces over a Field
	Definition of a Field
		Has a set F and operations:
		+ : F x F -> F, (λ,μ) -> λ + μ
		* : F x F -> F, (λ,μ) -> λ * μ
	Definition of a Vector Space over a field F
		Has a set V and operations:
		+ : V x V -> V, (v,w) -> v + w
		* : F x V -> V, (λ,v) -> λ * v

		AXIOMS:
		1) Commutativity - ∀u,v ∈ V
			u+v = v+u
		2) Associativity - ∀u,v,w ∈ V
			u+(v+w) = (u+v)+w
		3) Additive Identity Element - ∀v ∈ V
			∃ 0 ∈ V st v+0 = v
		4) Additive Inverse - ∀v ∈ V
			∃ u ∈ V st u+v = 0
		5) Multiplicative Identity Element - ∀ v ∈ V
			∃ 1 ∈ V st 1v = v
		6) Sensible Field + VS Scalar Multiplication - ∀λ,μ ∈ F, ∀v ∈ V
			(λμ)v = λ(μv)
		7) Sensible VS Addition + Scalar Multiplication - ∀λ ∈ F, ∀u,v ∈ V
			λ(u+v) = λu + λv
		8) Sensible Field Addition + VS Scalar Multiplication - ∀λ,μ ∈ F, ∀v ∈ V
			(λ + μ)v = λv + μv
	THEOREMS
		1) If u+w = v+w, then u=v
		2) 0 is a unique vector st ∀v ∈ V, u+v=v
		3) The additive inverse -u st u+(-u)=0 is unique
		4) λ0 = 0
		5) 0v = 0
		6) (-1)v = -v
		7) -(λv) = (-λ)v = λ(-v)
